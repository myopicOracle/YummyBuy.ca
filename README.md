# **YummyBuy: Deliciously Home-Baked E-Commerce**

## Background

> Recently, I've been offering to do free work for friends and family. One of them has a home-baking business and needed a new website for her shop. She's using a website builder for her current site, but finds it to be a little too cookie-cutter. In addition, there's a lot of extra features to navigate, sometimes negatively impacting her infrequent updates to the site. 

> My job is to create a simple platform for her customers to see her new creations and place orders. Currently, her orders come from a variety of sources, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, SMS text messages, groupchats etc. This makes it diffucult and time-consuming to keep track of all the outstanding orders. With this website, her hope is to funnel all of that traffic into one place, thereby making her life a lot easier. 

> Since I just finished the ["Shopping Cart Project"](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-shopping-cart) from The Odin Project's React Course not too long ago, I thought this would be a great opportunity to implement and experiment further with concepts like useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, useMemo, useRef, and concepts like the Context API, React Router, Axios, Memoization (memo/useMemo), and so on. 

## Initial Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, TailwindCSS 
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Config**: Vite, ESLint/Prettier

## Core Features
- **Filtering/Search**: Real-time product filtering with React hooks.
- **Cart**: Persistent cart state using Context API and local storage.
- **Authentication**: Login system with protected routes.
- **Payments**: Need to decide between Stripe, Paypal, Shopify


## Stretch Goals
- **Admin Dashboard**: Integrate a CMS for client to make changes.
- **Better State Mgmt**: Use Redux instead of Context API.
- **Robust Website Security**: Need better data protection if rolling out to users.
- **Product Display Case**: High-resolution images/video to show off her work.

## Potential Challenges
- Optimize cart performance with memoization.
- Design a relational database schema for orders.
- Optimize photo storage to keep data transfer costs low.
